### Docker

Adding a Dockerfile

    yo angular-fullstack:docker

This will add a Dockerfile to your dist folder

This file will survive `clean` operations so if it isn't to your requirements you can change it without losing it


#### Upstream Image 

* includes node modules for the angular-fullstack version in use

* uses an official node.js image

* incorporarates changes automatically using the hub.docker infrastructure
